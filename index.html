      <h1>RestAPI For SGPA-Calculator</h1>
      <p>
        This has been specifically built to suppliment the mobile application
        that I am developing. Feel free to use this irrespective of the
        mobile-app, with which you can integrate into your own
        applications/projects to get the data. As of now, this RestAPI provides
        the resluts of all R18 regulation students of the batch 2018. Soon, I
        would leverage this to other regulations as well.
